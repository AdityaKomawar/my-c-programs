# Determine Character
Any character is entered through the keyboard, write a program to
determine whether the character entered is a capital letter, a small
case letter, a digit or a special symbol.
The following table shows the range of ASCII values for various
characters:
| Characters       |   ASCII Values
|------------------|---------------------------------------
| A – Z            |   65 – 90
| a – z            |   97 – 122
| 0 – 9            |   48 – 57
| special symbols  |   0 - 47, 58 - 64, 91 - 96, 123 - 127

Note: It is not possible to print a smiling face with the ASCII value 1, as in any regular ASCII set, it is a control character for "Start of Heading", means not printable. The smiling face symbol for 1 belongs to an extended character set for MS DOS-consoles only. If the printing of 1 gets you no visible output, your terminal uses the standard ASCII character set and with printing 1 you actually trigger SOH (Start of Heading). So, may be you will not see special characters in your linux terminal but they are available in windows.
